# CCLA Managers and CCLA Signatories
As the CCLA manager or the CCLA signatory, you do the following CLA tasks after you [sign in to the CLA Corporate Console](Sign-In-to-the-CLA-Corporate-Console.md):

1. CCLA manager: [Add a Company to a Project](Add-a-Company-to-a-Project.md).

1. CCLA signatory: [Sign a Corporate CLA on behalf of the company](Sign-a-Corporate-CLA-on-Behalf-of-the-Company.md) and  [Review and Sign a Corporate CLA by Request](Review-and-Sign-a-Corporate-CLA-by-Request.md)—this signatory has legal authority to sign documents on behalf of the company.

1. CCLA manager: [Whitelist Contributors](Whitelist-Contributors.md)—each whitelist applies to the project for which the company has signed a Corporate CLA.

At any time, you can change the settings to manage your project CLA monitoring, and do other management tasks:

* [Add or Delete CCLA Managers](Add-or-Delete-CCLA-Managers.md)

* [View Employee Acknowledgements](View-Employee-Acknowledgements.md)

* [Edit the Company Name and Manager Details](Edit-the-Company-Name-and-Manager-Details.md)
