# Get Access to EasyCLA

**Important:** Before you get started, make sure your project meets the [EasyCLA Requirements](EasyCLA-Requirements.md).

**As the project manager, do these steps to get access to EasyCLA:**

1. If you do not have a Linux Foundation identification and credentials, go to <https://identity.linuxfoundation.org> and complete the form to sign up.

1. Share your sign-up username with the CLA administration team at <docucla@linuxfoundation.org>.

1. Provide sample ICLA and CCLA template documents to the CLA administration team at <docucla@linuxfoundation.org>.

After the CLA administration team confirms your setup, you can [Sign In to the CLA Management Console](Sign-In-to-the-CLA-Management-Console.md) to do the EasyCLA activities for [project managers](Project-Managers.md).

**Note:** CCLA managers can immediately start using the CLA Corporate Console because it does not require activation from the EasyCLA administration team. Simply [Sign In to the CLA Corporate Console](Sign-In-to-the-CLA-Corporate-Console.md) to do the EasyCLA activities for [CCLA Managers and CCLA Signatories](CCLA-Managers-and-CCLA-Signatories.md).
